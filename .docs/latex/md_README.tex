This project is a pizza restaurant simulator developed using 10+ Design Patterns. It simulates the operations of a pizza restaurant, including taking orders, preparing pizzas, and serving customers and shows all the inner workings of the kitchen.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysection{Design Patterns}\label{md_README_autotoc_md4}
We have used several design patterns in this project to ensure that the code is efficient, scalable, and easy to understand. These include\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Chain of Responsibility}}\+: To model the chefs in the kitchen performing their required tasks for an order.
\item {\bfseries{Command}}\+: For customers to place orders.
\item {\bfseries{Composite}}\+: To model the joining of tables to accommodate large groups of customers.
\item {\bfseries{Factory Method}}\+: For the creation of different components of a pizza. Like the pizza base, our variety of cheeses and toppings.
\item {\bfseries{Fa√ßade}}\+: To add convenience to the customers, allowing them to choose pre-\/configured, popular pizzas.
\item {\bfseries{Iterator}}\+: For the maitre\+D/\+Head-\/waiter to momentarily check on customers.
\item {\bfseries{Pager}}\+: For managing the communication between staff members.
\item {\bfseries{Memento}}\+: For saving and retrieving customer information, used when users try to repay or access their {\bfseries{Tab}}.
\item {\bfseries{State}}\+: To model customers\textquotesingle{} emotional state throughout the course of the game.
\item {\bfseries{Template Method}}\+: For customers to choose how they\textquotesingle{}d like their meal prepared. E.\+g. Fried/\+Grilled
\item {\bfseries{Builder}}\+: Once pizza components(E.\+g. toppings/sauce) are made they are put together to make the final product pizza
