## Introduction
This project is a pizza restaurant simulator developed using 10+ Design Patterns. It simulates the operations of a pizza restaurant, including taking orders, preparing pizzas, and serving customers and shows all the inner workings  of the kitchen.

## Design Patterns
We have used several design patterns in this project to ensure that the code is efficient, scalable, and easy to understand. These include:
- **Chain of Responsibility**: To model the chefs in the kitchen performing their required tasks for an order.
- **Command**: For customers to place orders.
- **Composite**: To model the joining of tables to accommodate large groups of customers.
- **Factory Method**: For the creation of different components of a pizza. Like the pizza base, our variety of cheeses and toppings.
- **Fa√ßade**: To add convenience to the customers, allowing them to choose pre-configured, popular pizzas.
- **Iterator**: For the maitreD/Head-waiter to momentarily check on customers.
- **Mediator**: For managing the communication between staff members.
- **Memento**: For saving and retrieving customer information, used when users try to repay or access their **Tab**.
- **State**: To model customers' emotional state throughout the course of the game.
- **Template Method**: For customers to choose how they'd like their meal prepared. E.g. Fried/Grilled
